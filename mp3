Step 1: Create Collections and Insert Sample Data

// Use your database

use schoolDB;

// Insert sample teachers
db.Teachers.insertMany([
  { Tname: "Praveen", dno: 1, dname: "Computer", experience: 8, salary: 12000, date_of_joining: ISODate("2018-05-01") },
  { Tname: "Anita", dno: 2, dname: "IT", experience: 6, salary: 11000, date_of_joining: ISODate("2019-06-15") },
  { Tname: "Ramesh", dno: 3, dname: "E&TC", experience: 7, salary: 9500, date_of_joining: ISODate("2017-03-10") },
  { Tname: "Kiran", dno: 1, dname: "Computer", experience: 5, salary: 10500, date_of_joining: ISODate("2020-08-20") }
]);


// Insert sample students
db.Students.insertMany([
  { Sname: "Xyz", roll_no: 1, class: "10th" },
  { Sname: "Abhi", roll_no: 2, class: "12th" },
  { Sname: "John", roll_no: 3, class: "11th" }
]);

Step 2: Queries for Required Operations

Find all teachers alphabetically by name

db.Teachers.find().sort({ Tname: 1 });


Find teachers of the Computer department


db.Teachers.find({ dname: "Computer" });


Find teachers of Computer, IT, and E&TC departments

db.Teachers.find({ dname: { $in: ["Computer", "IT", "E&TC"] } });


Find teachers of Computer, IT, and E&TC with salary >= 10000

db.Teachers.find({ dname: { $in: ["Computer", "IT", "E&TC"] }, salary: { $gte: 10000 } });


Find student with roll_no = 2 or Sname = "xyz"

db.Students.find({ $or: [{ roll_no: 2 }, { Sname: "xyz" }] });


Update Praveen’s experience to 10 years or insert new if not exists

db.Teachers.updateOne(
  { Tname: "Praveen" },
  { $set: { experience: 10 } },
  { upsert: true }
);


Update department of all IT department teachers to COMP

db.Teachers.updateMany(
  { dname: "IT" },
  { $set: { dname: "COMP" } }
);


Find teachers' names and their experience

db.Teachers.find({}, { _id: 0, Tname: 1, experience: 1 });


Delete all teachers from IT department

db.Teachers.deleteMany({ dname: "IT" });


Display first 3 documents in ascending order prettily

db.Teachers.find().sort({ Tname: 1 }).limit(3).pretty();
